  <h1> Rob Johnson </h1>
  <h2> Major: Computer Applications</h2>
  <p> My goal for this course is for me to develope my webpage building skills.
    I would like to make webpages faster; right now, CSS and certain elements in HTML look foreign,
  and I would like to change that.  
</p>
  <p> Ideally, I want to get to a point where I can build a website to showcase projects that I've 
    made that involve IT work. A lot of jobs tend to want employees to showcase labs/projects that they've made
    and displaying them on a website that I've created would be very helpful. 
  </p>
